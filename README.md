# Soccer Player Value Prediction Web App

## Overview
This web application predicts the market value of a soccer 
player based on their age, games played, and goals scored. 
The model used for predictions is a linear regression model trained on a dataset of soccer player statistics.
## Model Limitations
Simplicity of the Model: The model used is a linear regression model, which may 
not capture more complex relationships between features and the target variable (market value).
Limited Features: The model only uses three features (age, games played, and goals scored), 
but the market value of a player is likely influenced by many other factors, such as position, team performance, and league level.
Training Data: The model was trained on a specific dataset of soccer player statistics, 
and its performance may vary when applied to players outside of the dataset.
Assumptions: The model assumes that age, games played, and goals scored are sufficient 
to predict the market value of a player, which may not be accurate in all cases.
